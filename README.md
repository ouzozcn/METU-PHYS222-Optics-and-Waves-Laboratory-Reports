# ✳️ PHYS222 - Optics and Waves Laboratory Reports

Welcome to my collection of lab reports for **PHYS222: Optics and Waves Laboratory** 🌊! These reports were written in LaTeX (TeX format) and are here to serve as examples for students at **Middle East Technical University’s Department of Physics**. Whether you're looking to refine your report-writing skills, learn about specific experiments, or just get inspired for your own reports, this repository is for you! 🎉

## 📂 What's Inside

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different experiment from the PHYS222 lab course. Inside, you'll find:

- 📄 **Lab reports in TeX format**: View the source code for each report.
- 📊 **Sample data and analysis**: See how data from experiments is structured and analyzed.
- ✨ **Detailed explanations**: Get insights into both the physics concepts and the methods used to present them effectively in a lab report.
- 📄 **Course Template**: The course template policy is followed while writing reports.


Feel free to explore, download, and even modify these files to aid your learning journey. Just remember to give credit if you’re using this as a base for your work! 😊

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the most out of this repository, you'll need a basic understanding of LaTeX. If you're new to it, don’t worry! Here’s how to get started:

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Download a modern TeX distribution package manager like [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).
3. Install a LaTeX editor like [TeXStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) or [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/).
4. Open any experiment folder first, then open the `document.tex` file with your TeX editor, and start exploring or customizing it to fit your experiment!
5. If you want to use .PDF files, you can open the `document.pdf` file in the related folder.
